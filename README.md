# Price Elasticity of Demand 
Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling project focused on Price Elasticity of Demand (PED). The project utilizes a dataset that includes sales, prices, and competition data to calculate and analyze PED across various products, stores, and time periods.

What is Price Elasticity of Demand?
Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) is a measure of how the quantity demanded of a good or service responds to changes in its price. It is a crucial concept in economics that helps businesses and economists understand consumer behavior, set prices strategically, and predict how changes in price can affect sales and revenue.

Formula
The formula to calculate PED is:

PED = (% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in Price)

Where:

A PED > 1 indicates elastic demand (consumers are highly responsive to price changes).
A PED < 1 indicates inelastic demand (consumers are less responsive to price changes).
A PED = 1 indicates unitary elasticity (the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price).

Example
If the price of a product increases by 10%, and as a result, the quantity demanded decreases by 20%, the PED would be:

PED = (-20%) / (10%) = -2

This indicates that the demand is elastic, meaning consumers are highly responsive to price changes.

Types of Elasticity
Elastic Demand (PED > 1): Consumers are highly responsive to price changes. For example, if the price of luxury goods, like high-end electronics, increases, the demand might drop significantly.
Inelastic Demand (PED < 1): Consumers are less responsive to price changes. For instance, essential goods like gasoline typically have inelastic demand because people need to buy them even if prices rise.
Unitary Elasticity (PED = 1): The percentage change in quantity demanded is exactly equal to the percentage change in price. For example, if a 10% increase in price leads to a 10% decrease in quantity demanded, the demand is unitary elastic.

Why is Price Elasticity of Demand Important?
Understanding PED is vital for several reasons:

Pricing Strategy: Companies can use PED to set prices optimally. For example, if demand is inelastic, a company might increase prices to boost revenue without significantly affecting sales volume.
Revenue Forecasting: PED helps in predicting how changes in price will impact overall revenue, aiding in financial planning and strategy.
Market Segmentation: By analyzing PED across different segments, companies can identify which customers are more price-sensitive and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
Competitive Advantage: Companies can leverage knowledge of PED to gain a competitive edge by adjusting prices more strategically than their competitors.

Industries Where PED is Crucial
Price Elasticity of Demand is relevant across numerous industries, but its impact is particularly pronounced in the following sectors:

Retail: In retail, understanding PED helps in pricing products to maximize revenue, especially during sales or discount periods.
E-commerce: Online retailers use PED to optimize pricing algorithms that adjust prices in real-time based on consumer demand and competition.
