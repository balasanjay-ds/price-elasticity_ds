# Price Elasticity of Demand 

## Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling project focused on **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**. The project utilizes a dataset that includes sales, prices, and competition data to calculate and analyze PED across various products, stores, and time periods.

## What is Price Elasticity of Demand?
**Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)** is a measure of how the quantity demanded of a good or service responds to changes in its price. It is a crucial concept in economics that helps businesses and economists understand consumer behavior, set prices strategically, and predict how changes in price can affect sales and revenue.

### Formula
The formula to calculate PED is:

  **PED = (% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in Price)**

Where in this case:

- A **PED > 1** indicates **elastic demand** (consumers are highly responsive to price changes).
- A **PED < 1** indicates **inelastic demand** (consumers are less responsive to price changes).
- A **PED = 1** indicates **unitary elasticity** (the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price).

### Example
If the price of a product increases by 10%, and as a result, the quantity demanded decreases by 20%, the PED would be:

  *PED = (-20%) / (10%) = -2*


This indicates that the demand is elastic, meaning consumers are highly responsive to price changes.

### Types of Elasticity
- **Elastic Demand (PED > 1):** Consumers are highly responsive to price changes. For example, if the price of luxury goods, like high-end electronics, increases, the demand might drop significantly.

- **Inelastic Demand (PED < 1):** Consumers are less responsive to price changes. For instance, essential goods like gasoline typically have inelastic demand because people need to buy them even if prices rise.

- **Unit Elasticity (PED = 1):** The percentage change in quantity demanded is exactly equal to the percentage change in price. For example, if a 10% increase in price leads to a 10% decrease in quantity demanded, the demand is unitary elastic.

## Why is Price Elasticity of Demand Important?
Understanding PED is vital for several reasons:

1. **Pricing Strategy:** Companies can use PED to set prices optimally. For example, if demand is inelastic, a company might increase prices to boost revenue without significantly affecting sales volume.

2. **Revenue Forecasting:** PED helps in predicting how changes in price will impact overall revenue, aiding in financial planning and strategy.

3. **Market Segmentation:** By analyzing PED across different segments, companies can identify which customers are more price-sensitive and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

4. **Competitive Advantage:** Companies can leverage knowledge of PED to gain a competitive edge by adjusting prices more strategically than their competitors.
