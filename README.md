# Price Elasticity of Demand 
Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling project focused on Price Elasticity of Demand (PED). The project utilizes a dataset that includes sales, prices, and competition data to calculate and analyze PED across various products, stores, and time periods.


Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) is a measure of how the quantity demanded of a good or service responds to changes in its price. It is a crucial concept in economics that helps businesses and economists understand consumer behavior, set prices strategically, and predict how changes in price can affect sales and revenue.

Formula:
The formula to calculate PED is:

PED
=
%
 Change in Quantity Demanded
%
 Change in Price
PED= 
% Change in Price
% Change in Quantity Demanded
​
 
Where:

A PED > 1 indicates elastic demand (consumers are highly responsive to price changes).
A PED < 1 indicates inelastic demand (consumers are less responsive to price changes).
A PED = 1 indicates unitary elasticity (the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price).
Example:
If the price of a product increases by 10%, and as a result, the quantity demanded decreases by 20%, the PED would be:
PED
=
−
20
%
10
%
=
−
2
PED= 
10%
−20%
​
 =−2
This indicates that the demand is elastic, meaning consumers are highly responsive to price changes.

Why is Price Elasticity of Demand Important?
Understanding PED is vital for several reasons:

Pricing Strategy: Companies can use PED to set prices optimally. For example, if demand is inelastic, a company might increase prices to boost revenue without significantly affecting sales volume.

Revenue Forecasting: PED helps in predicting how changes in price will impact overall revenue, aiding in financial planning and strategy.

Market Segmentation: By analyzing PED across different segments, companies can identify which customers are more price-sensitive and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

Competitive Advantage: Companies can leverage knowledge of PED to gain a competitive edge by adjusting prices more strategically than their competitors.

Industries Where PED is Crucial
Price Elasticity of Demand is relevant across numerous industries, but its impact is particularly pronounced in the following sectors:

Retail: In retail, understanding PED helps in pricing products to maximize revenue, especially during sales or discount periods.
E-commerce: Online retailers use PED to optimize pricing algorithms that adjust prices in real-time based on consumer demand and competition.

Project Structure
Data: The dataset used in this analysis contains sales data, including item prices, quantities sold, and competition prices across different stores and time periods.
Analysis: The project includes EDA to explore relationships between price, quantity, and competition, followed by the calculation of PED for various products.
Modeling: Regression models and machine learning techniques are used to predict demand based on price and other factors.
Visualizations: Insights are presented through clear and impactful visualizations to aid in understanding the behavior of demand with respect to price changes.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of economic principles to real-world data, providing insights into how businesses can leverage price elasticity of demand for strategic decision-making. The analysis and models presented here serve as a valuable addition to my data science portfolio, showcasing my ability to handle complex datasets and extract meaningful insights that can drive business value.
